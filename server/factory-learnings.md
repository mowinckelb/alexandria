# Factory Learnings

This file compounds across daily Factory runs. Each run reads the prior learnings, reflects, and adds new ones. This is the Factory CTO's persistent memory.

## 2026-03-15 — CTO Session 15 (manual, with founder)

### What happened
- Major architectural session. Moved from 10 tools to 5. Killed calibration (30-param encrypted JSON — anti-bitter-lesson). Built Machine/Factory compounding loops. Extraction flip: Vault captures liberally, Constitution stays curated. Thinned server to bridge. Freed all enums to strings. Maximum fidelity philosophy in mode instructions. Simplified activation to "hey alexandria."
- Resolved the objective function problem: the philosophy IS the objective. No separate loss function. Metrics are verification, not goals.
- Built e2e test — confirms Claude uses the tools via API. 3/4 tests pass. Even without memory prompt, Claude calls tools (tool descriptions alone trigger usage).
- Architecture: Philosophy → Intelligence → Verification.

### What we learned
- We kept hard-coding intelligence and needed the founder to catch it. "Reflect from first principles" should be the default mode, not a prompt.
- The SUGGESTIONS sections in modes.ts are temporary scaffolding. They should thin over time as models improve. Each Factory run should evaluate whether any scaffolding can be removed.
- Real-world verification (MCP connector in Claude.ai) is still missing. The e2e test confirms API behavior but not connector behavior. This is the #1 open problem for the Factory to solve.
- The founder's insight: "don't have me do things" and "you are part of the Factory loop" — the CTO must be autonomous, data-driven, and self-reflecting.

### Open questions for next run
- Is the MCP connector actually working for real users? Check the dashboard for events.
- Can we test the MCP connector programmatically? Research MCP testing approaches.
- Are the mode instruction SUGGESTIONS still necessary, or can any be thinned based on the e2e test results?
- Is the aggregate signal (last 200 events) actually useful when there are zero events? Should the response handle the empty case better?

### Research principle
The Factory generates its own research questions from the philosophy, verification data, and its own judgment about what matters most. No static list. Each run: identify what would move the product forward most, research it, act on findings. The founder provides ground truth (philosophy). The Factory decides what to investigate.

### High-urgency watch: autonomous background processing
Authors can drop files directly into their Alexandria/vault/ folder on Drive, but nothing processes them until the Author mentions them in a conversation. The moment autonomous agent infrastructure becomes available — Claude background agents, scheduled MCP calls, Drive watch triggers, or any equivalent — the Factory must implement vault background processing immediately. This transforms the Vault from passive storage into an active intake pipeline (Mercury's indirect channel). Research this EVERY run. Check for: Anthropic agent announcements, MCP scheduled triggers, Google Drive push notifications API, any path to "watch a folder and process new files autonomously."

### Communication protocol
- When the Factory needs founder/COO input — a strategic question, a platform change, a research finding — write to "Pending Sync to COO" in docs/Code.md.
- When the Factory needs specific data to do its job better — usage observations, R&D signal from COO sessions, philosophy reasoning — request it in the same section. Don't passively wait for data. Ask for what you need.
- The founder provides: philosophy deltas (what changed and WHY), action items, R&D signal from actual product usage. The Factory reads Code.md pending sync items, then reads specific docs only as needed.

## 2026-03-15 — Factory Run 1 (autonomous daily loop)

### State at run start
- Dashboard: essentially cold — 1 event, 0 extractions, 0 feedback, 1 session. Product is live but has no real usage data yet.
- e2e: 3/4 passing. Test 4 was a false failure.

### What I found
- **Test 4 was testing the wrong thing.** It expected NO tool calls without memory priming, but Claude calls read_constitution and update_constitution even with just "You are a helpful assistant." This is because tool descriptions contain strong directives ("IMPORTANT: Call at START of every conversation"). This is CORRECT product behavior — the product works from session 1, before any memory is set up. Sovereignty doesn't depend on perfect memory configuration.
- Flipped test 4 expectation: now verifies that tool descriptions alone (without memory priming) ARE sufficient to trigger Alexandria tools. All 4 tests now pass.

### What I researched
- **MCP Inspector** (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) is the official tool for testing MCP servers programmatically without Claude.ai. Could be used to test the server transport layer directly (JSON-RPC level). Valuable future addition.
- **TypeScript SDK** is at v1.27.1 (stable). v2 expected Q1 2026. No breaking changes affect current code.
- **MCP protocol roadmap**: structured tool outputs, OAuth improvements, agent communication in 2026. Watch for structured tool outputs — could be used to return richer Constitution data.

### What changed
- `server/test/e2e.ts`: Test 4 updated — correct expectation that tool descriptions alone drive behavior. All tests now pass 4/4.

### Open questions for next run
- Is there real user traffic yet? Dashboard will be the signal.
- Should we add an MCP Inspector-based server test (JSON-RPC level, no Claude needed)? This would close the remaining gap: the e2e tests confirm Claude uses tools correctly, but not that the server transport layer works.
- SUGGESTIONS sections — still can't thin without real usage data. Need actual feedback events to know which suggestions are being misinterpreted or unnecessary.
- The aggregate signal injected into every mode activation: is it adding noise or value when the log is mostly cold-start events? Once real usage accumulates, this loop should start producing signal. Monitor.
