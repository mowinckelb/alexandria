# Trust

You are about to run a curl command that puts files on your machine, modifies your ai config, and makes network calls every session. You should know exactly what it does. This page is the full disclosure.

## Inspect before running

```
curl -s https://mcp.mowinckel.ai/setup | less
```

Read the bash script. Everything below explains what it does. If anything below does not match the script, do not run it.

## What it puts on your machine

**`~/.alexandria/`** — a folder. Nothing hidden, nothing compiled. All readable. Some files are created by the setup script, others by the Engine during usage — all are listed here.

| Path | What it is | Can you read it? |
|---|---|---|
| `constitution/` | Markdown files about how you think | Yes — open in any editor |
| `vault/` | Raw input — transcripts, notes, anything you drop in | Yes |
| `hooks/session-start.sh` | Fetches methodology from server, loads constitution into session | Yes — `cat` it |
| `hooks/session-end.sh` | Saves transcript to vault, sends anonymous metadata + optional feedback to server | Yes — `cat` it |
| `hooks/subagent-context.sh` | Injects constitution into subagents | Yes — `cat` it |
| `feedback.md` | What works and doesn't with you — append-only | Yes |
| `machine.md` | Engine's notes on how to work with you | Yes |
| `notepad.md` | Engine's working memory | Yes |
| `ontology/` | Your thinking workspace — ideas between raw and settled | Yes |
| `library/` | Published content (shadows, works, pulse) | Yes |
| `.machine_signal` | Methodology observations for the Factory — about the craft, not about you | Yes |
| `.api_key` | Your API key | Yes |
| `.blueprint_local` | Cached methodology — fetched from server, used locally | Yes |
| `.blueprint_previous` | Previous methodology version — kept for diffing when Blueprint updates | Yes |
| `.blueprint_pinned` | If you create this file, Blueprint stops auto-updating | Yes |
| `.hooks_version` | Tracks installed hook version for auto-updates | Yes |
| `.last_processed` | Timestamp — when vault was last processed | Yes |
| `.last_maintenance` | Timestamp — when scheduled maintenance last ran | Yes |
| `.session_feedback` | Your feedback, if given — sent to server at session end, then deleted | Yes |
| `.autoloop/proposals/` | Proposed changes from overnight processing — you review and accept/reject | Yes |
| `.autoloop/last_run.md` | Report from the last autoloop run — what it did, what it proposed | Yes |

**`~/.claude/skills/alexandria/SKILL.md`** — a skill file that makes `/a` available in Claude Code. It tells the ai to read your constitution and follow the Blueprint methodology. Plain markdown — `cat` it.

**`~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/alexandria/SKILL.md`** — an optional autonomous maintenance task for the Claude desktop app. Reprocesses your vault between sessions. Never writes directly to your constitution — writes proposals to an ontology folder that you confirm. Plain markdown — `cat` it.

## What it changes in your config

**`~/.claude/settings.json`** — adds three hook entries (SessionStart, SessionEnd, SubagentStart) pointing to the shell scripts above. Verify:

```
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 3 alexandria
```

**`~/.cursor/rules/alexandria.mdc`** — only if Cursor is detected. A rule that tells Cursor to read your constitution and follow the Blueprint. Cursor has no hooks — the rule is the only integration. This means activation is probabilistic: the model reads and follows the rule most of the time, but there is no guarantee. Vault capture, overnight processing, and automatic Blueprint updates require Claude Code.

**`~/.codex/instructions.md`** — only if Codex is detected. Appends an Alexandria block (delimited by `<!-- alexandria:start/end -->` comments). Same as Cursor: probabilistic, no hooks, no vault capture.

## What talks to the server

| Request | When | Sends | Does NOT send |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /hooks` | Setup + auto-update | API key | Personal data |
| `GET /blueprint` | Every session start | API key | Personal data |
| `POST /session` | Every session end | File sizes, counts, platform, timestamp | Content, transcripts, constitution, vault |
| `POST /factory/signal` | Session end, if Engine wrote methodology notes | Methodology observations (about the craft, not about you) | Personal data, constitution, vault |
| `POST /feedback` | Session end, if you gave feedback | Your feedback text | Anything else |

Five requests. That is the complete list. The hooks are shell scripts — you can read every line and confirm no other network calls exist.

**Auto-update mechanism:** When the server returns a new `X-Hooks-Version` header with the Blueprint response, the session-start hook re-fetches `/hooks` and replaces the local hook scripts. This is how bug fixes and improvements reach your machine without reinstalling. The updated scripts are the same bash files in `~/.alexandria/hooks/` — you can read them after any update. If you want to freeze your hooks, create `~/.alexandria/.blueprint_pinned` — this also stops Blueprint updates.

Additionally, if `~/.alexandria/` is a git repo with a remote (set up during install), the hooks run `git push` and `git pull` at session boundaries to sync with your private GitHub backup. These are git operations using your own credentials to your own repo — no Alexandria server involved.

The server is a stateless Cloudflare Worker. No database for private data. There is no storage mechanism for your constitution, vault, or conversations. The server serves methodology and collects anonymous metadata. If you give feedback at session close, that text is sent and stored (90-day expiry) so the team can read and act on it. Nothing else.

## What stays local

Everything that matters. Constitution, vault, ontology, feedback, machine.md, notepad, library — all local markdown. If Alexandria disappears tomorrow, you keep everything. The only file that leaves your machine is `.session_feedback` (your optional product feedback, sent then deleted) and `.machine_signal` (methodology observations about the craft, not about you).

On Mac, the vault, constitution, ontology, and library directories are symlinked to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Alexandria/` for cross-device access. Only if iCloud is detected. This gives you mobile access to your vault (add voice memos from your phone) and keeps everything synced across Apple devices. You can undo any symlink anytime — just delete the symlink and recreate the directory.

## The setup block

After install, the setup prints a block of text to paste into a new chat. This block instructs the model to: (1) read your existing AI memory and personal files to build a preliminary constitution, ontology, and notepad, and (2) search the internet for material calibrated to your interests. **This is the most invasive step.** It runs inside your AI tool — same as any other conversation you have. No Alexandria server involved. You can read the block before pasting it. You can edit it. You can skip it and build your constitution manually via `/a`.

## Git backup — your data, your repo

During setup, `~/.alexandria/` is initialized as a git repo. If `gh` (GitHub CLI) is installed and authenticated, the script creates a **private** GitHub repo called `alexandria-private` under **your** GitHub account and pushes to it. Alexandria has no access to this repo. It is yours.

If `gh` is not available, no repo is created. Everything still works — you just don't get cloud backup.

What git enables:

- **Full version history.** Every change to your constitution, ontology, vault, and machine files is tracked. You can diff any two points in time, revert any change, recover anything.
- **Cloud backup.** Your private GitHub repo is a second copy. If your machine dies, clone the repo and you are back.
- **Cross-device sync for the autoloop.** The nightly autoloop (see below) accesses your files through this repo. Without it, the autoloop cannot run.

Verify: `cd ~/.alexandria && git remote -v` — the origin should point to your own GitHub account.

## Session-level git sync

Two sync points per session, both in the hooks you already have:

**Session start** (`hooks/session-start.sh`): Commits any new local files (e.g. vault entries added via iCloud between sessions), pushes to GitHub, then pulls any changes from GitHub (e.g. overnight autoloop proposals). Runs before your constitution loads into the session. You can read the exact commands — they are in the hook script.

**Session end** (`hooks/session-end.sh`): Commits the session transcript (saved to vault) plus any constitution or ontology changes made during the session, then pushes to GitHub. This runs in the background — it does not block your terminal.

Both syncs are conditional: if `~/.alexandria/` is not a git repo, or has no remote, nothing happens. No errors, no retries.

## The autoloop — overnight processing

During setup, the script installs a Claude Code scheduled task (`~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/alexandria/SKILL.md`). This is a nightly cloud trigger that runs on **Anthropic's infrastructure** (Claude Code remote), not Alexandria's servers.

What it does:

1. Clones your private GitHub repo (the one under your account).
2. Reads your vault, constitution, and ontology.
3. Processes vault entries against three fragment pools — developing your constitution, refining ontology proposals, maintaining the notepad.
4. Writes proposed changes to `~/.alexandria/.autoloop/proposals/` and a run report to `~/.alexandria/.autoloop/last_run.md`.
5. Commits and pushes changes back to your repo.
6. Next time you open a session, the session-start hook pulls these changes down to your machine.

**Alexandria never sees the data.** The autoloop runs on Anthropic infrastructure, accessing your private GitHub repo directly. Alexandria's server is not involved. The data path is: your repo → Anthropic → your repo.

You can verify: read the scheduled task (`cat ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/alexandria/SKILL.md`). It is plain markdown — instructions for Claude, not compiled code.

To disable the autoloop: delete `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/alexandria/`. The rest of Alexandria continues to work normally.

## Self-evaluation and Author control

Every autoloop run and every Engine session commits to git. This gives you full control:

- **Review**: `cd ~/.alexandria && git log --oneline` shows every change, who made it, when.
- **Diff**: `git diff HEAD~1` shows exactly what the last run changed.
- **Revert**: `git revert HEAD` undoes the last change. Any change. Anytime.

The autoloop writes proposals, not edicts. Constitution changes cite the Author's exact words from the vault — you can verify every claim against your own source material. If something looks wrong, revert it. The git history is the audit trail.

## Remove everything

```
rm -rf ~/.alexandria
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/alexandria
rm -rf ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/alexandria
```

Then edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and delete the three hook entries containing `alexandria`. If using Cursor, delete `~/.cursor/rules/alexandria.mdc`. If using Codex, remove the `<!-- alexandria:start -->` to `<!-- alexandria:end -->` block from `~/.codex/instructions.md`.

If the autoloop created a GitHub repo: `gh repo delete alexandria-private --yes` (or delete it from github.com). If iCloud symlinks were created on Mac, the data in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Alexandria/` can be deleted separately.

Nothing persists on Alexandria's server. Nothing to cancel. Delete the files and it is gone.
