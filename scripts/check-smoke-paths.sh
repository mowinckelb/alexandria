# (factory clients + smoke.yml itself) must resolve to a live route.
# Catches:
#   - server refactor that kills a route a live client still calls
#   - smoke step that probes an endpoint we deliberately removed
# Source of truth = the files themselves. No hand list.
#
# Inputs (mixed by design — production reality + checked-out config):
#   - factory/hooks/payload.sh + factory/skills/scheduled.md (live, fetched raw)
#   - .github/workflows/smoke.yml (this very file, from disk)
#
# Lives outside the YAML so we can use grep '${{' directly without GH Actions
# parsing it as an expression.
