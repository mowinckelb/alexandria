"""Daily brief sender — syncs ~/alexandria with origin, then reads
~/alexandria/system/.brief_outbox (one line, written by the autoloop or any
other producer) and SMTP-sends it. Falls back to a default line when the
outbox is empty.

Verification loop: also detects autoloop work that didn't reach master
(stranded on a claude/* branch from a failed master push) and surfaces a
rescue command in the brief body. Without this, silent strands look identical
to silent days.

Sovereign by construction: no network calls except git (the Author's own
remote) and SMTP (the Author's own provider).
