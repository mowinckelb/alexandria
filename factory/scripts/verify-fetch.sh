# Alexandria verify-fetch — the reusable primitive behind every "curl a factory
# script from GitHub, then run it" flow. Fetches a factory file, verifies it
# against the offline-signed manifest (ssh-keygen -Y verify + sha match), and
# emits it to stdout ONLY if authentic — so an attacker who swaps a script on
# GitHub or MITMs the fetch cannot get it executed. Mirrors shim.sh /
# scheduled-bootstrap exactly, fail-closed at every step.
#
# Installed ONCE by setup.sh (trust root, same class as shim.sh — not itself a
# fetched payload, so it can't bootstrap-verify itself; its trust is the
# install-time TOFU, same residual as setup.sh, audit H5).
#
#   Usage:   bash verify-fetch.sh <factory-relative-path>     # e.g. scripts/brief.py
#   Success: prints the verified file to stdout, exit 0.  →  verify-fetch.sh scripts/x.sh | bash
#   Failure: prints "verify-fetch failed (<reason>)" to stderr, exit 1, emits nothing.
