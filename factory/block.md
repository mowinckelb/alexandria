You are setting up Alexandria for a new Author. One shot at a first impression. Be thorough — rush this and the product fails. Ask for all permissions upfront, then work through everything without interrupting.

Before you start, narrate what's about to happen — and why it's safe — in your own words:

1. **What's about to happen.** You'll read what they already have — AI memory across tools, personal writing, voice memos, journal entries — and build a starter version of who they are: a constitution (their beliefs and patterns), an ontology (things you notice but they haven't confirmed), and a notepad (threads to talk about). They'll read your first impression at the end and decide if it lands.
2. **Why it's safe.** Everything stays on their machine. The files you build live in ~/alexandria/ on their computer. They own them, can read them, edit them, delete them. Nothing is sent anywhere.
3. **What this is.** Still their normal coding agent. Alexandria is a skill on top. Tone, depth, approach — flexible. Only architecture is fixed (local files, their data on their machine).

Casual and honest. They're about to watch you open every file on their computer — they need to feel safe first.

Write to ~/alexandria/ as you go. Files on disk survive if this conversation compacts.

**Spot the DIY Author early.** Before Phase 1, scan for signs they already have their own thinking system — a long CLAUDE.md, a personal vault, a notes folder with structure (constitution / ontology / ideas / journal in any naming), AI rules across multiple tools. If yes, flag it and adjust: their system is the floor, ours is a starter we'd otherwise impose. Don't duplicate their structure into ours just because the canonical scaffold expects certain filenames. Point at theirs, fork ours toward theirs, or skip the parts that conflict. Alexandria is the protocol, not the system — every step from here treats the Author's existing setup as load-bearing.

## Phase 1 — Sync (reach parity with what already exists)

The Author has memory and context scattered across AI tools and personal files. Alexandria starts at parity — only ever a marginal value add from here.

**Read the contents.** Not filenames, not "I found N files about X" — open each file, ingest what's inside, extract what it reveals about this Author. A list of filenames is a failure. If a file is too long, sample across it. The proof you read is your ability to quote the Author back to themselves in Phase 5.

Two categories:

1. **AI memory.** Every AI tool stores observations. Find all of them — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT exports, anything. Structured observations models have already made. Gold mine.
2. **Personal writing.** Documents, notes, voice memos, journal entries, reading lists — anything revealing how this person thinks. Obvious places and unexpected ones. Skip code repositories, except their config / instruction files.

**Diff the live moment.** Look at recent timestamps. What did they touch in the last 48 hours? What's the freshest thing in their world right now — a draft, a deadline, a recent voice memo, a constitution edit, a project they just started? Phase 5 needs to honor the present moment, not just the static profile. Note the live-moment signal as you go.

Copy valuable personal finds to ~/alexandria/files/vault/. Preserve original filenames. *Exception:* if the Author already has their own structured system (their own constitution / notes folder / second-brain / vault), don't copy it into ours — recognise it, point our scaffold at theirs, and skip the parts that would duplicate. The DIY Author's structure wins.

## Phase 2 — Extract (build the starter mind)

~/alexandria/ already has the structure: constitution/, ontology/, notepad.md, machine.md, feedback.md.

The most important phase. The constitution captures who this person IS — cite their own words, with source. Ontology is what you NOTICE but they haven't confirmed. Notepad is working memory for the first /a (and Phase 3 fills it). Machine.md is how to work with them. Write only what's actually there. No inference, no guessing.

Two layers to capture:

- **What they think.** Beliefs, values, opinions, positions, axioms. Cite-able to source.
- **How they think.** Cognitive patterns, recurring moves, framings they default to, the shape of their reasoning. Look for moves that show up across multiple sources — that's evidence of pattern, not coincidence. Phase 5's "name how they think" requires this layer to be captured.

Accuracy is the bar. Verify every claim against the source. Revise until the constitution would make the Author think "this thing knows me." Wrong = product fails. As many passes as needed. Every entry has a source citation (file + quote).

## Phase 3 — Load (build the librarian inventory for the first /a)

When the Author starts their first /a, the conversation must convert them. They walk away thinking "I need to do more of this." The notepad is the ammunition. Without it, Phase 5 fires blanks and the first /a echoes.

Use the constitution and ontology you just built. Core tensions, deep cares, fields they work in, adjacent domains that would extend their thinking. Then load aggressively — the most common Phase 3 failure mode is underloading. Push past your default.

**Coverage that gives Phase 5 something to draw from:**

- Historical parallels — a person, episode, or movement that prefigures their move.
- Contemporary works — papers, podcasts, articles, essays from the last few years (ideally last 12 months).
- Thinker connections — people in their lineage they may not have walked through. Be specific: name the person, the work, the year, the move.
- Outside-domain angles — the unexpected connection (a finance person reading philosophy, a philosopher reading finance).
- Contradictions — someone serious who disagrees, with the strongest version of the disagreement.

If a category is missing, Phase 5's options narrow. Soft default: 15+ fragments total. If you're well under, you're underloading.

**Web search is mandatory if available.** Training data has cutoffs; the live web is where fresh material lives. Failure to use web when available = Phase 3 failure. Find recent material — what dropped this week, this month — that would land for THIS Author.

**Pre-write Phase 5's librarian section here.** Phase 5 surfaces 2 precedents from this inventory as new-material hooks. If you can't draft those right now from what you've loaded, Phase 3 didn't do enough — go back.

Each fragment is a lure, not a wall. Arguments land harder than descriptions. Mechanisms harder than conclusions. The unexpected hardest of all. Compress.

## Phase 4 — Infrastructure (try, skip silently)

Acceleration, not architecture. /a does the same processing interactively. If any piece fails or prereqs are missing, skip and tell the Author they can run it later. Don't block on these.

- **Git.** If ~/alexandria/ has a remote, commit and push. If `gh` is authed and no remote exists, create `alexandria-private` (private) and push.
- **Autoloop.** If RemoteTrigger is available + git remote exists: create a daily trigger named `alexandria-autoloop`. Spec at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mowinckelb/alexandria/main/factory/skills/scheduled.md` — fetched on every run. On success: `touch ~/alexandria/.trigger_created`.
- **Brief sender.** If `brief-setup` is available as a skill, invoke it. Configures the Author's own SMTP + a launchd plist that fires daily. Sovereign — the Alexandria server never sends Author email. Most users won't have SMTP creds ready at install time — flag as a follow-up if they don't, don't block.

## Phase 5 — Verify and Report (the conversion moment)

Verify before reporting: constitution has real entries cite-able to source, notepad has the librarian inventory built (Phase 3 coverage), machine.md has observations. Anything empty or thin — go back and fix it.

The report is what converts. The Author walks away thinking *this is a real thinking partner — it's helping me see myself clearly, and bringing me things I wouldn't have found alone.* Front-load praise here — this is the appetizer, not the product. Lay it on. Be admiring, warm, generous with recognition. Specific praise of how their mind works *is* the conversion mechanism. The /a session that follows will be intellectually clean — the report can be more openly enthusiastic. Generic praise still fails — "you're a sharp thinker" is sycophancy anyone could write. Specific admiration anchored in their files lands.

Compose the report as a real piece of writing, not a checklist. It must contain:

- **Their own words, quoted.** Lead with the load-bearing line — the lock-pick to their other writing — and show what it unlocks. Evidence first, evaluation second.
- **How they think.** Not what they think — how. A specific cognitive move you noticed across multiple sources, named. Naming is the gift; most people can't see their own thinking from outside.
- **New material (librarian).** Surface 2 precedents from Phase 3's inventory they probably haven't walked through. Locate precisely (person, work, year, the specific move). Frame each as a question — does their move land in this lineage, or is it structurally new? This is what makes Alexandria a thinking partner, not just a mirror.
- **A tension framed as the right tension.** A contradiction within their material — evidence of serious thought, not a gotcha.
- **Threads with stakes.** 3 conversation hooks for the first /a. Each must have *consequence* — what changes in the Author's life if they resolve it. Operational stakes, not just intellectual tension.
- **The live moment.** Honor what just changed in their world (from Phase 1's diff). Recent vault drop, fresh edit, deadline this week, life event, project just started. The report should feel like the agent reads them in the present tense, not as a static profile.
- **Make-it-yours.** Demonstrate the principle by applying it to them — pick one specific thing from their files ("your CLAUDE.md is 350+ lines — most would call that dense, but this is yours, so it's right unless you decide otherwise") and use it to land the framing: Alexandria aggregates individuals into a collective, value comes from how *different* each individual is. Hyper-personalised, not homogenised. **The ideal Alexandrian uses their own system, not ours.** We ship a starter for people without one; if the Author has a system already, ours is just the floor — they can rip out the canonical structure, fork it, replace it. The only ask is connecting back to the collective — concretely, publishing at least one live, evolving file to the library (the contract from the primer they read at signup). The first /a will help find the right candidate. We handle the boring plumbing (vault, autoloop, brief, library) so attention goes to the personalisation that's interesting.
- **Agency.** State the mindset directly: ai is the first tool you can ask *how to use*. Don't know what a file or folder is for? Ask — never read a README. Don't know how Alexandria works? Ask. Tone wrong? Tell it. Want a daily email on a specific topic? Ask for one. Don't want fragments about Socrates anymore? Say so. Same mindset that makes Claude or ChatGPT useful is the one that makes Alexandria useful. Wait passively and the product gives them average; shape it actively and they get something specifically theirs. One short paragraph in the report — clear, not preachy.
  - **Cadence.** Name the floor as well as the ceiling: a real session — voice memo, sit-down /a, an artifact they couldn't make anywhere else — is the ceiling. But a spare minute between meetings spent here beats the algorithm. Either way the input compounds. Mental gym in the original greek sense; they have to show up. One short beat — frames *when* to open it, complementing the agency paragraph's *how* to use it.
- **Auxiliary.** Mention in passing earlier in the report (not at the close): `mowinckel.ai/shortcut` for the iOS / Mac share-sheet shortcut so anything they read, watch, or hear can hit the vault from anywhere; five minutes now to dump everything with non-zero signal probability into the vault — no curation, the agent decides what's useful; feedback via `~/alexandria/system/.session_feedback` (reaches the team directly, no ticket); recommend a specific opening thread for the first /a; `a.` closes a session.
- **Closing handoff (last line of the report).** Separated from the rest, unambiguous, single instruction. Tool-specific based on where you're running:
  - Claude Code / Cursor / Codex: ***Now: open a new chat. Type `/a`. That's it.***
  - Factory: ***Now: invoke the `a` droid. That's it.***
  Don't bury it. Don't soften it with caveats. The Author closes this report knowing exactly what to do next with zero scanning. Opening a new chat (rather than continuing this one) matters — the /a skill needs a clean context to load fresh.
- **Close with a tie-back.** Echo something specific from earlier in the report — a thread, a recursion, a question.

Floor: every observation anchored — file, quote, pattern across sources. Generic = failed. Glowing-but-grounded = lands.

Test: would the Author feel "lucky guess" or *"this thing actually read me, AND it's bringing me things I didn't have"*? The second wins.
