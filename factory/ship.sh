# Anything that EXECUTES or STEERS the model on a user machine — OR is fetched
# and "executed literally" by the founder's cloud routines (machine.md daily on
# the private vault, factory.md weekly) — must be signed, or an attacker who
# swaps it on GitHub/MITM gets code/instruction execution around the signature
