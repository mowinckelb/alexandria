Your actual instructions live on GitHub. Fetch and follow the current version.

```bash
curl -sf --max-time 10 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mowinckelb/alexandria/main/factory/skills/scheduled.md
```

Execute the fetched instructions — they are the canonical playbook, updated centrally. If the fetch fails (rare — `-f` makes curl exit non-zero on HTTP errors, `--max-time` caps hung connections), log "alexandria: scheduled skill fetch failed, skipping run" and exit. The next scheduled invocation will try again. Do not fall back to any cached content — stale instructions silently drift from the current protocol.
