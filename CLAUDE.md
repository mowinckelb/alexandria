# Alexandria

Greek philosophy infrastructure. Rides the user's existing ai. Does not run its own models or store user data.

Founder: Benjamin Mowinckel. Solo founder + ai agents. Relocating to SF April 2026.

**Canonical surfaces:** `https://alexandria-library.com` (website, Vercel) and `https://api.alexandria-library.com` (API, Cloudflare Worker — protocol, OAuth, billing, Library, cron). `mowinckel.ai` + `www.mowinckel.ai` 308-redirect to the canonical apex. `api.mowinckel.ai` stays bound to the same Worker so legacy CLI/skill installs that cached the old URL keep working; treat it as deprecated. `mcp.mowinckel.ai` is the older alias on the same retire path. Override only via `SERVER_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` when intentional.

## Architecture — Four Layers

Everything in Alexandria maps to one of four layers:

1. **Protocol** (`server/src/protocol.ts` + `auth.ts` + `kv.ts` + `crypto.ts` + `db.ts` + `file-access.ts` + `marketplace-catalog.ts` + `marketplace.ts` + `audit.ts`) — The incompressible core. 7 endpoints, ~1700 lines including the visibility gate (`file-access.ts`), the module catalog (`marketplace-catalog.ts`), the Author-feedback substrate (`marketplace.ts`), and the tamper-evident access audit (`audit.ts`). Three obligations: account (payment), file (publish monthly), call (communicate). This is what makes Alexandria a protocol, not a product.

2. **Factory** (`factory/`) — The founder's system, public on GitHub, forkable. 19 files: canon (methodology), hooks (shim + payload), setup script, skills (claudecode, cursor, codex, scheduled), templates (agent, machine, notepad, feedback, constitution/, marginalia/, vault/, library/), onboarding block. Any Author can fork and modify. The marketplace evolves canon defaults from cross-Author signal.

3. **Machine** (`~/alexandria/`) — Each Author's personal system. Constitution, vault, marginalia, machine.md, notepad, feedback. Lives locally, never on the server. The product IS this folder. Alexandria stores what Authors publish, never what they think.

4. **Company** (`server/src/` everything else + `app/`) — Operational overhead. OAuth, billing, email, analytics, cron, Library CRUD, admin endpoints. This layer should shrink over time.

## Code

- **Website:** `app/` (Next.js, Vercel). Landing page: `app/components/LandingPage.tsx`.
- **Server:** `server/src/` (Hono, Cloudflare Workers). One file per concern:
  - `worker.ts` (entry + middleware), `protocol.ts` (the protocol — file, call, library, marketplace), `routes.ts` (company HTTP handlers), `auth.ts` (accounts + API keys), `accounts.ts` (account management + admin), `email.ts` (Resend + all templates), `cron.ts` (health digest + followup + engagement), `analytics.ts` (event log + dashboard), `billing.ts` (Stripe), `library.ts` (Library CRUD), `kv.ts` (KV persistence), `templates.ts` (HTML), `cors.ts` (CORS), `crypto.ts` (encryption), `db.ts` (D1/R2 accessor), `file-access.ts` (visibility gate — the only path that reads protocol/shadow/work bytes from R2), `marketplace-catalog.ts` (GitHub module catalog + push-webhook cache busting), `marketplace.ts` (Author-feedback substrate, writes to private GitHub repo), `audit.ts` (tamper-evident access audit mirrored to a hash-chained GitHub repo), `library-signal.ts` (daily funnel/engagement snapshot consumed by the founder), `time.ts` (PT formatter).
  - Stateless server. No private user data stored. KV for accounts/events, D1 for Library metadata + protocol data, R2 for published content.
- **Factory:** `factory/` — public, forkable. Canon methodology, hooks, skills, templates, setup, onboarding block.
- **Static assets:** `public/` (includes `public/docs/` for public artifacts).
- **In-flight task plans:** `.tasks/<task-name>.md`. Each plan is self-contained (any agent in any tool reads it cold and can execute), references this `AGENTS.md` for architecture, and is deleted (or moved to `.tasks/done/`) when the task ships. Use this for cross-session task hand-off — plans are for the next thing to do; durable signal routes to canon, never agent memory (canon-not-memory policy, `~/alexandria/files/core/agent.md`).
- **Investor docs:** kept out of this public repo. Live in `~/alexandria-inc/private/partners/` (private GitHub `alexandria-inc`). Shared directly with partners (email/DM) when needed — no public URL, no `/partners/` route.
- **Pre-commit hook:** `scripts/pre-commit` gates server type check + app build (mirrors CI). Activate on fresh clone: `git config core.hooksPath scripts`.
- **Build:** `cd server && npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=dist` (server). **Deploy:** `cd server && npx wrangler deploy` then check health. **Push:** `bash scripts/push.sh` (pushes + waits for CI + reports results). Always use `push.sh` instead of raw `git push` — **except** when the diff touches `factory/hooks/payload.sh` or any `factory/canon/*.md`: those are signature-gated, so use `bash factory/ship.sh "msg"` (re-signs `factory/manifest.txt`, then pushes). Skipping ship for canon/hook changes leaves the manifest out of sync, breaks payload signature verification for every Author, and silently freezes them on the cached payload.
- **Server health:** `curl https://api.alexandria-library.com/health`
- **Stack:** Vercel (website), Cloudflare (DNS + server + KV + D1 + R2), Resend (email), GitHub (code + OAuth), Stripe (billing), Mercury (banking, API), Claude (intelligence). All hybrid (CLI or API-controllable). Zero external dependencies.
- **Storage architecture:** Stateless server, sovereign local files (`~/alexandria/` — local + private GitHub; `iCloud/alexandria/` is Apple-native input only), thin persistence for collective Library (D1 for metadata/discovery, R2 for published content, KV for accounts/events).

### Protocol Endpoints

Seven endpoints. The protocol core:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| PUT | `/file/{name}` | Publish a file (the file obligation) |
| GET | `/library` | Browse all published files |
| GET | `/library/{id}` | List one Author's files |
| GET | `/library/{id}/{name}` | Read a specific file |
| POST | `/call` | Report module usage (the call obligation) |
| GET | `/marketplace` | Browse module usage |
| GET | `/marketplace/{module}` | Read usage for one module |

### Company Endpoints

Operational overhead — OAuth, billing, email, admin:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/alexandria` | Protocol handshake (unauthenticated: spec; authenticated: status) |
| GET | `/auth/github` | OAuth initiation |
| GET | `/auth/github/callback` | OAuth callback |
| GET | `/account` | Billing portal redirect |
| DELETE | `/account` | Account deletion (GDPR-ready) |
| POST | `/brief` | Morning brief (autoloop trigger) |
| POST | `/feedback` | Author-explicit feedback (typed into `~/alexandria/system/.session_feedback`, posted at session end, stored in private `mowinckelb/alexandria-feedback` GitHub repo) |
| GET/GET | `/email/less`, `/email/stop` | Email preferences |
| GET/GET | `/brief/less`, `/brief/stop` | Brief preferences |
| POST | `/admin/nudge` | Nudge uninstalled users (admin) |
| POST | `/admin/email` | Send email (admin) |

## Visual Workflow

**See before shipping.** For any frontend work, use `scripts/see.mjs` (Playwright) to screenshot and visually verify. Read the PNGs with the Read tool — you are multimodal.

- **Screenshot any URL:** `node scripts/see.mjs <url> [--full] [--dark] [--only desktop|tablet|mobile]`
- **Local dev:** `node scripts/see.mjs localhost --port 3000`
- **Design reference:** `~/alexandria/files/core/design.md` — craft substrate (900 lines of concrete CSS physics, anti-patterns, thresholds). Read before any frontend work. Not taste — that's `~/alexandria/files/constitution/Taste.md`.
- Screenshots save to `.see/` at repo root (gitignored), auto-cleaned to last 30.
- **Loop:** build → screenshot → evaluate against design.md → fix → screenshot → ship.

## Style

- "ai" is always lowercase unless at the start of a sentence or in a proper noun (e.g. "Apple Intelligence"). This is a brand and taste decision.

## Design Constraints

- **Pure marginal value add.** Alexandria must never override, compete with, or degrade the user's existing workflows, memory, or tools. Passive mode is read-only context + optional marginalia writes. Active mode (/a) is opt-in. The user's existing system is the floor — Alexandria only adds.
- **All .md files maximise total net signal for the model.** This is THE governing principle for every file an agent reads. Everything downstream is capped at file fidelity. Self-contained (0 to 100 with zero prior context). Max signal, not min length. But net, not gross (overwhelm the model and total received signal drops). Never compress signal. Only delete noise or true redundancy.
- **Data and intent, not intelligence.** Alexandria ships data (the Author's files) and intent (axioms, philosophy, developmental objective). Never intelligence. The host LLM IS the intelligence. Every structure must be optimizable by the model — unstructured markdown, no schemas, no prescribed formats. When models improve, the same data yields more. Zero workflow changes.
- **Bitter lesson:** general methods leveraging computation beat hand-engineered solutions. No structured parameters, fixed schemas, or hand-crafted rules. Unstructured text/JSONL. Let the model figure it out.
- **Philosophy IS the objective:** no numerical loss function or optimization target. Metrics are verification, not goals.
- **Build as little as possible.** Ride existing infrastructure. Server is intent layer, not intelligence layer.
- **Live the philosophy.** Every artifact — factory canon, investor docs, code, brand — must visibly carry the human edge Alexandria claims is the tiebreaker. The test: could a competing team write the same thing from first principles? If yes, it has failed. Generic = interchangeable = dead.

## Session Close

Capture is a layer, not a trigger. **Every** session that surfaces signal captures it — the methodology bar (`factory/canon/methodology.md` § Session Close, § Passive Mode): extraction fires on *any* natural sign-off, and the Engine is never in a state where closing the terminal loses signal. Close is the safety net, not the primary extraction point. Work sessions additionally report. The two are orthogonal layers, not rival protocols — a coding session that surfaces a constitutional fragment runs both. The old "two mutually-exclusive protocols, clean separation" framing was the bug: it let non-/a sessions drop capture entirely, which is exactly the signal loss the methodology forbids.

### Capture — every session, silent. The product behavior.

Runs whenever crystallised signal surfaced this session — whether the sign-off was "a." or "close"/"end" or any natural exit. Act as a normal Machine would for any Author; this IS the product test. Route each, skip any with nothing:

- **Constitution.** Crystallised signal about the founder as a person → `~/alexandria/files/constitution/`. Opinions, stories, patterns, contradictions revealed this session.
- **Machine.md.** How to work with this Author — what worked, what didn't, cognitive-style observations → `~/alexandria/files/core/machine.md`.
- **Notepad.** Parked questions, accretion candidates, what to carry forward → `~/alexandria/files/core/notepad.md`.
- **Feedback.** Methodology observations → `~/alexandria/files/core/feedback.md`. (Stays local — the Engine never auto-sends. To push to the marketplace, the Author types it into `~/alexandria/system/.session_feedback` himself.)

Silent. No report. This is the product working. A pure-/a session is capture only — that plus a hazy-fragment delta, nothing more. If this capture feels wrong, the product is wrong.

### Work report — coding / company sessions ("close" / "end").

Additive on top of capture, for sessions that did company or code work:

- **Delta.** What changed about Alexandria the company. Not what you did — what's different now. Hazy fragments only.
- **Open threads.** What's unresolved. What the next session should pick up. Ordered by priority. Then close them optimally without being asked: execute the drafted or obvious resolution for every thread that doesn't genuinely need the founder (every line revertible via git), commit-protect orphaned work, park the rest with a pre-drafted resolution. Ask the founder only what truly needs his verdict — one line per question — else ask nothing. (Claude Code: the `/close` skill re-injects this protocol fresh at end-of-session.)
- **Meta loop.** Product learnings → factory canon (`factory/canon/methodology.md`).
- **Founder loop.** How-to-work-with-the-founder signal (communication patterns, preferences, anti-patterns) → `~/alexandria/files/core/machine.md` / `feedback.md` — canon, never agent memory. (This is the capture section's Machine/Feedback, named again here so a work-close never skips it.)

**Principles (both):**
- Hazy fragments scale. Weeds do not. Keep it compressed.
- Signal, not summary. Don't restate what the founder already saw — extract what compounds.
- If nothing happened in a loop, skip it. No empty sections.
- The whole output should take <60 seconds to read.

## Code Quality — Server

Before committing any server code change:

1. **Correctness:** Trace the full execution path, not just the changed function. Check all callers of anything modified.
2. **Build:** Run `npm run build` in server/. Must pass.
3. **Test:** Run `npm test` if tests exist. Check the e2e test (`server/test/e2e.ts`).
4. **No regressions:** Review recent commits for anything the change might break.
5. **Bitter lesson compliance:** No structured parameters, fixed schemas, or hand-crafted rules. Unstructured text/JSONL. Soft defaults that thin as models improve.
6. **Statelessness:** Server stores nothing user-specific in plaintext. Account blobs are AES-256-GCM encrypted in KV; the API key is never stored, only its SHA-256 hash, indexed for O(1) auth. There is no refresh token — rotation requires a fresh OAuth round-trip.
7. **Deployment:** After deploying (`cd server && npx wrangler deploy`), check health: `curl https://api.alexandria-library.com/health`.

## Working With the Founder

See `~/alexandria/files/core/agent.md` for principles, communication style, Three-Phase Execution, and Reflect Gate (loaded globally in every session).

Three-way split — keep them separate:

- **This repo** (`~/alexandria-inc/public/code/` → public GitHub `alexandria`) — product source code. Intentionally open. No secrets (use env vars).
- **User vault** (`~/alexandria/` → private GitHub `alexandria-private`) — founder-as-user-0 content: agora, marginalia, constitution, notepad, personal writing, session captures. Every future user will have a `~/alexandria/`; this is the founder's instance.
- **Company business** (`~/alexandria-inc/private/` → private GitHub `alexandria-inc`) — founder-as-CEO materials: investor docs, pitch, brand, early drafts, fundraise tracker. Not part of the product. Not in the public repo.

**Founder's Constitution** lives at `~/alexandria/files/constitution/` — Core.md, Love.md, Power.md, Mind.md, Taste.md. READ Core.md first for any task. READ Taste.md first for any creative task. `~/alexandria/files/core/design.md` for craft substrate.
