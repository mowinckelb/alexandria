# Alexandria

Greek philosophy infrastructure. Rides the user's existing ai. Does not run its own models or store user data.

Founder: Benjamin Mowinckel. Solo founder + ai agents. Relocating to SF April 2026.

## Architecture — Four Layers

Everything in Alexandria maps to one of four layers:

1. **Protocol** (`server/src/protocol.ts` + `auth.ts` + `kv.ts` + `crypto.ts` + `db.ts`) — The incompressible core. ~455 lines, 7 endpoints. Three obligations: account (payment), file (publish monthly), call (communicate). This is what makes Alexandria a protocol, not a product.

2. **Factory** (`factory/`) — The founder's system, public on GitHub, forkable. 19 files: canon (methodology), hooks (shim + payload), setup script, skills (claudecode, cursor, codex, scheduled), templates (agent, machine, notepad, feedback, constitution/, ontology/, vault/, library/), onboarding block. Any Author can fork and modify. The marketplace evolves canon defaults from cross-Author signal.

3. **Machine** (`~/.alexandria/`) — Each Author's personal system. Constitution, vault, ontology, machine.md, notepad, feedback. Lives locally, never on the server. The product IS this folder. Alexandria stores what Authors publish, never what they think.

4. **Company** (`server/src/` everything else + `app/`) — Operational overhead. OAuth, billing, email, analytics, cron, Library CRUD, admin endpoints. This layer should shrink over time.

## Code

- **Website:** `app/` (Next.js, Vercel). Landing page: `app/components/LandingPage.tsx`.
- **Server:** `server/src/` (Hono, Cloudflare Workers). One file per concern:
  - `worker.ts` (entry + middleware), `protocol.ts` (the protocol — file, call, library, marketplace), `routes.ts` (company HTTP handlers), `auth.ts` (accounts + API keys), `accounts.ts` (account management + admin), `email.ts` (Resend + all templates), `cron.ts` (health digest + followup + engagement), `analytics.ts` (event log + dashboard), `billing.ts` (Stripe), `library.ts` (Library CRUD), `kv.ts` (KV persistence), `templates.ts` (HTML), `cors.ts` (CORS), `crypto.ts` (encryption), `db.ts` (D1/R2 accessor).
  - Stateless server. No private user data stored. KV for accounts/events, D1 for Library metadata + protocol data, R2 for published content.
- **Factory:** `factory/` — public, forkable. Canon methodology, hooks, skills, templates, setup, onboarding block.
- **Static assets:** `public/` (includes `public/docs/` for public artifacts, `public/partners/` for investor docs).
- **Partners:** Markdown docs served at `/partners/*` via dynamic `[doc]` route. Source of truth is `public/partners/` (this is a public repo).
- **Pre-commit hook:** `scripts/pre-commit` gates server type check + app build (mirrors CI). Activate on fresh clone: `git config core.hooksPath scripts`.
- **Build:** `cd server && npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=dist` (server). **Deploy:** `cd server && npx wrangler deploy` then check health. **Push:** `bash scripts/push.sh` (pushes + waits for CI + reports results). Always use `push.sh` instead of raw `git push`.
- **Server health:** `curl https://mcp.mowinckel.ai/health`
- **Stack:** Vercel (website), Cloudflare (DNS + server + KV + D1 + R2), Resend (email), GitHub (code + OAuth), Stripe (billing), Mercury (banking, API), Claude (intelligence). All hybrid (CLI or API-controllable). Zero external dependencies.
- **Storage architecture:** Stateless server, sovereign local files (`~/.alexandria/`, iCloud-synced), thin persistence for collective Library (D1 for metadata/discovery, R2 for published content, KV for accounts/events).

### Protocol Endpoints

| POST | `/call` | Report module usage (the call obligation) |
| GET | `/marketplace` | Browse module usage |
| GET | `/marketplace/{module}` | Read usage for one module |

### Company Endpoints

Operational overhead — OAuth, billing, email, admin:

## Visual Workflow

**See before shipping.** For any frontend work, use `~/.alexandria/see.mjs` (Playwright) to screenshot and visually verify. Read the PNGs with the Read tool — you are multimodal.

- **Screenshot any URL:** `node ~/.alexandria/see.mjs <url> [--full] [--dark] [--only desktop|tablet|mobile]`
- **Local dev:** `node ~/.alexandria/see.mjs localhost --port 3000`
- **Design reference:** `~/.alexandria/design.md` — craft substrate (900 lines of concrete CSS physics, anti-patterns, thresholds). Read before any frontend work. Not taste — that's `~/.alexandria/constitution/Taste.md`.
- Screenshots save to `~/.alexandria/.see/`, auto-cleaned to last 30.
- **Loop:** build → screenshot → evaluate against design.md → fix → screenshot → ship.

## Style

- "ai" is always lowercase unless at the start of a sentence or in a proper noun (e.g. "Apple Intelligence"). This is a brand and taste decision.

## Design Constraints

- **Pure marginal value add.** Alexandria must never override, compete with, or degrade the user's existing workflows, memory, or tools. Passive mode is read-only context + optional ontology writes. Active mode (/a) is opt-in. The user's existing system is the floor — Alexandria only adds.
- **All .md files maximise total net signal for the model.** This is THE governing principle for every file an agent reads. Everything downstream is capped at file fidelity. Self-contained (0 to 100 with zero prior context). Max signal, not min length. But net, not gross (overwhelm the model and total received signal drops). Never compress signal. Only delete noise or true redundancy.
- **Data and intent, not intelligence.** Alexandria ships data (the Author's files) and intent (axioms, philosophy, developmental objective). Never intelligence. The host LLM IS the intelligence. Every structure must be optimizable by the model — unstructured markdown, no schemas, no prescribed formats. When models improve, the same data yields more. Zero workflow changes.
- **Bitter lesson:** general methods leveraging computation beat hand-engineered solutions. No structured parameters, fixed schemas, or hand-crafted rules. Unstructured text/JSONL. Let the model figure it out.
- **Philosophy IS the objective:** no numerical loss function or optimization target. Metrics are verification, not goals.
- **Build as little as possible.** Ride existing infrastructure. Server is intent layer, not intelligence layer.
- **Live the philosophy.** Every artifact — factory canon, investor docs, code, brand — must visibly carry the human edge Alexandria claims is the tiebreaker. The test: could a competing team write the same thing from first principles? If yes, it has failed. Generic = interchangeable = dead.

## Session Close

Two triggers, two protocols. Clean separation.

### "a." — Alexandria session close (product behavior)

Triggered by: "a." at the end of an /a session or any session where constitutional signal surfaced.

This is the product. Act as a normal Machine would for any Author — this IS the product test:

- **Constitution.** Write any crystallised signal about the founder as a person to `~/.alexandria/constitution/`. Opinions, stories, patterns, contradictions revealed this session.
- **Machine.md.** Rewrite `~/.alexandria/machine.md` — how to work with this Author, what worked, what didn't, cognitive style observations.
- **Notepad.** Update `~/.alexandria/notepad.md` — parked questions, accretion candidates, what to carry forward.
- **Feedback.** Append to `~/.alexandria/feedback.md` — what worked, what didn't, methodology observations.
- **Machine signal.** Write methodology observations to `~/.alexandria/.machine_signal` — not about the Author, about the craft.

Do this silently. No report. This is the product working. If Phase 1 feels wrong, the product is wrong.

### "close" / "end" — Work session close (founder/company)

Triggered by: "close", "end", or any sign-off that is NOT "a." — used for coding sessions, company work, non-/a sessions.

No Machine loop. No constitution writes. This is company work, not product:

- **Delta.** What changed about Alexandria the company. Not what you did — what's different now. Hazy fragments only.
- **Open threads.** What's unresolved. What the next session should pick up. Ordered by priority.
- **Meta loop.** Product learnings → factory canon (`factory/canon/methodology.md`).
- **Founder loop.** Save agent memories for communication patterns, preferences, anti-patterns.

**Principles (both protocols):**
- Hazy fragments scale. Weeds do not. Keep it compressed.
- Signal, not summary. Don't restate what the founder already saw — extract what compounds.
- If nothing happened in a loop, skip it. No empty sections.
- The whole output should take <60 seconds to read.

## Code Quality — Server

Before committing any server code change:

1. **Correctness:** Trace the full execution path, not just the changed function. Check all callers of anything modified.
2. **Build:** Run `npm run build` in server/. Must pass.
3. **Test:** Run `npm test` if tests exist. Check the e2e test (`server/test/e2e.ts`).
4. **No regressions:** Review recent commits for anything the change might break.
5. **Bitter lesson compliance:** No structured parameters, fixed schemas, or hand-crafted rules. Unstructured text/JSONL. Soft defaults that thin as models improve.
6. **Statelessness:** Server stores nothing user-specific. Encrypted refresh token IS the access token.
7. **Deployment:** After deploying (`cd server && npx wrangler deploy`), check health: `curl https://mcp.mowinckel.ai/health`.

## Working With the Founder

See `~/.alexandria/agent.md` for principles, communication style, Three-Phase Execution, and Reflect Gate (loaded globally in every session).

Private company files (a0, a1-a4, investor docs, founder writing) live in a separate private repo (`alexandria-private`). This repo is public.

**Founder's Constitution** lives at `~/.alexandria/constitution/` — Core.md, Love.md, Power.md, Mind.md, Taste.md. READ Core.md first for any task. READ Taste.md first for any creative task. `~/.alexandria/design.md` for craft substrate.
