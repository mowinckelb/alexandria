            Your kid&rsquo;s drawing on the fridge. You could print a better version. You would never swap it. Not because the drawing is&nbsp;good. Because your kid&nbsp;made&nbsp;it.
          </Body>

          <Body>
            Your intelligence, your strength, your skills, your empathy&nbsp;&mdash; machines are learning to do all of it. But that feeling about the drawing? No machine can give you&nbsp;that. Not because the technology is not there&nbsp;yet. Because it is about who&nbsp;made&nbsp;it.

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <Body>
            Imagine an alien shows up. Smarter than any human. Better taste. Better skills. It opens a restaurant&nbsp;&mdash; best food you have ever had. It designs buildings&nbsp;&mdash; stunning. Would you admire the work? Yes. But is it the same as something a human&nbsp;made?

            But that feeling alone is not enough. You still have to be good enough. Nobody hires a warm waiter who drops every plate. Nobody buys a handmade bowl that&nbsp;leaks. The feeling only matters once you have cleared the&nbsp;bar.
          </Body>

          <Body>
            AI helps you clear the bar. You use AI the way humans have always used tools&nbsp;&mdash; to get good enough. The alien gets good enough too. Same bar, both clear&nbsp;it.
          </Body>

          <Body>
            So the only question left is: does it matter that a human did&nbsp;this? Not always. But in the games where it does&nbsp;&mdash; and there are more of them than you think&nbsp;&mdash; the human wins. Not because their version is&nbsp;better. Because it is&nbsp;human.
          </Body>

          <Pull className="py-4">
            The game is not about being better than&nbsp;AI.<br />It is about being human where it&nbsp;counts.

          <Body>
            A grandmother making bowls for her village. A founder whose company carries their conviction. A creator whose audience follows them, not their output. The closer the circle, the more your humanity matters and the lower the&nbsp;bar. You do not need to be famous. You do not even need to be the best. You need to be you, be good enough, and&nbsp;create.

            But the thing that makes you irreplaceable&nbsp;&mdash; your mind, your taste, your judgment&nbsp;&mdash; is the one thing that weakens if you do not use it. Every time you let AI think for you, something fades. The way you forgot arithmetic once you had a calculator. Except this is not arithmetic. This is your ability to&nbsp;think.

          <Pull className="py-6 sm:py-8">
